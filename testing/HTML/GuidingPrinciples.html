    <h2>Gaudy Principles</h2>
    <p>Lo, all you Gaudy Developers! Lo, all you analysts and designers! Hear how to be Gaudy and be enlightened.</p>

    <p>Do not strive to be as Google, bending to the needs of advertisers. That way lies only sorrow. Nor strive to be
        as Apple, stagnant and rotten to the core. You will accomplish nothing in that manner. Always be mindful of the
        users’ needs and strive to aid them. In this way you will strengthen others, who may in turn strengthen you.</p>

    <p>Do not be bland, and so be ignored. Be bright and bold, fearlessly showing your colours and revealing your
        identity. In this way you be recognised and celebrated.</p>

    <p>Do not leave anything to chance, and so be taken as a fool. Always be intentional in your actions, so that you
        may be respected.</p>

    <p>Be careful not to overlook anything, or cause harm by inaction. Be proactive in identifying and combatting risks,
        so that you will always be prepared, and that you may provide guidance when needed.</p>

    <p>Do not squander your effort where it is not needed, and so cause delays. Do all that is necessary to complete
        your work.</p>

    <p>Never leave your work in a way that another cannot continue it. Remember that your time here may be short, and
        that others will come after you.</p>

    <p>Do not keep your work hidden, and so be forgotten. Communicate openly and frequently, and expose all that you
        have done, that others may delight in your work.</p>

    <p>And finally, do not despair! They that have no passion will not succeed, but those passionate ones will bring
        happiness and joy wherever they go.</p>

    <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rember the needs of users and other developers.</li>

        <li>Use colourful decorations and avoid flat design.</li>

        <li>Gaudy is intentionally, well, Gaudy. This is, frankly, a bit of a joke, but must not be acknowledged as
            such. It is important that colours and styles still work together well, so test thoroughly and frequently.
            The joke loses its meaning (and just makes us look silly) if not taken seriously.
        </li>

        <li>There is no need to rush through the development process. Spend time thinking about how your work could be
            improved, what is good about it, what is not so good, and so on. Anticipate the questions you may be asked
            in a showcase and have answers prepared. You should discuss this with the team too.
        </li>

        <li>Focus on what is necessary for the project. Focussed effort is required in any project, or to learn any
            skill. It is good to make a note if you think of a new idea that could be added, but you must finish your
            current work first!
        </li>

        <li>People might join or leave quite suddenly on any project, and that goes double for FDMs Pods! Always make
            sure that you have documented what you are working on to the point that someone else could pick it up
            tomorrow without needing to contact you!
        </li>

        <li>Communicate openly and frequently, both inside our team and externally to stakeholders. If you are having
            trouble, ask for help straight away.
        </li>

        <li>Work hard and be passionate. We don’t expect everyone to have the same knowledge, skills, or experience, but
            we do expect that everyone will work to the best of their ability. Use this as an opportunity to practice
            working in an effective team.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Background & Motivation</h3>

    <p>We are concerned that the World Wide Web is heading in a dangerous direction. Most people browsing the web are
        now using Google Chrome, or another derivative of Chromium, giving Google far too much power to dictate web
        standards. The biggest competitor is Apples’s Safari browser, with Mozilla Firefox a now distant third. This is
        problematic for the following reasons: Google and Apple have perverse incentives to make the web more hostile to
        users; there is little diversity of implementation of core web features; websites often fail to account for the
        needs of their users. </p>

    <p>Google is essentially an advertising company – they control the largest share of the market with Chrome, and
        effectively control the open-source Chromium project, which most alternatives are derived from (now including
        Opera and Edge). Chrome has consistently implemented features that are hostile to users and beneficial for
        advertisers, including tracking, forced telemetry, and crippling of extensions that might block adds. Apple’s
        profits do not come from their Safari browser, but rather their app store. While this means that they are
        generally less friendly to advertisers than Google, they have no incentive to contribute to the development of
        the web, as pushing people away from browsing and toward using apps provides more value for them. </p>

    <p>There is a shocking lack of diversity in the implementation of web technologies. All browsers today are
        ultimately derived (directly or indirectly) either from Konqueror (KHTML was adapted to the renderers now used
        in Safari and Chromium) or Netscape Navigator (the precursor to Firefox, and the Gecko renderer). This has led
        to a lack of experimentation with web technologies – everything is now HTML + CSS + JavaScript, with little else
        ever supported. The semantic nature of HTML is now often ignored. </p>

    <p>We plainly do not like flat design. Browsing the web has become increasingly dull – most sites look both similar
        and uninspiring. While we believe there is some value in consistency, minor differences between websites (even
        from the same vender, e.g. Microsoft) destroy this. Flat design trends tend to make it hard to distinguish
        buttons from labels (or sometimes even links!) and often lead to excessive whitespace around content,
        particularly on low-density desktop screens, as more and more sites cater to phones over PCs. </p>

    <p>Our guiding principles are chosen to respond both these concerns and the needs of any FDM Pod project. While the
        aim of the project is to produce a tool for sharing a web browsing session with colleagues, the way that we go
        about it matters. Although not one of the guiding principles, we chose to implement a new browser, and not just
        an extension, to address the lack of diversity in the web. </p>

    <p>Putting users first is a direct response to the practices of Google and Apple – Firefox would be acceptable to us
        based on this principle. </p>

    <p>Using bright colours and themes addresses the problems of flat design trends. If you can recall, think of the
        bright colours and plasticky look of Windows XP. While many people considered it an eyesore, it was always
        obvious exactly what each control was! </p>

    <p>We lean into Gaudiness as an act of rebellion. The bright colours, excessive detail, and rejection of blandness
        is a constant reminder of these principles. It must be taken seriously, despite it being silly. </p>

    <p>We want to set up for success. Web browsers are very complicated, likely the most complicated software on your
        computer. To tackle this, we need to be vigilant against risks, and identify problems as soon as possible. We
        should not be afraid to adjust our plans or ideas when necessary. </p>

    <p>Our resources are very limited, especially compared to Google! We don’t have time to waste on minor features that
        won’t hold up the project if they are missing. This may lead to our product feeling quite simple in comparison,
        but if it works and embodies our principles then we can call it a success. </p>

    <p>FDMs pods often change structure quite quickly, as people are placed with clients or else leave the company, or
        as consultants join or return from a placement. This means that we need to always provide as much information as
        possible to other team members, so that the project can continue. </p>

    <p>Effective communication is important for any project. We should be aiming to help each other when possible, and
        to communicate on open channels (e.g. group chats, not private conversations) whenever appropriate. This lets
        everyone benefit from whatever you are sharing. Discussing our ideas with each other lets us develop them
        together and may improve our project in surprising ways. </p>

    <p>We must embody passion in our work. This means that we should be diligent to complete our assigned tasks, be
        respectful of our team members, contribute to team discussions, and ultimately aim to enrich people’s lives with
        the work that we do. We hope that all professionals (in any industry) will remember this principle, having
        passion for and taking pride in their work. </p>

    <p>We believe that by keeping these principles we will not just succeed in this project, but also that we will
        inspire those around us to act in a similar manner – rejecting unjust practices and lazy design; planning for
        the future while being ready to respond to change; communicating well and supporting those around us; and
        ultimately making the world a nicer place for everyone to live in. </p>
