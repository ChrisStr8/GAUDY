<h1>Colours and Fonts</h1>
<p>
    We use colour as a way to distinguish different types of elements. In keeping with our theme, we try to use
    contrasting colours where possible, and stick to variations of the primary colours (red, green, and blue) and the
    secondary colours (cyan, magenta, and yellow).
</p>
<br />
<p>
    Choosing fonts was difficult, as we wanted to use decorative fonts with embellishments, while also maintaining
    readability.
</p>
<br />
<h1>Headings use the 'Permanent Marker' font.</h1>
<h2>It is big and bold, and stands out from the lighter body fonts, like a heading should.</h2>
<h3>HTML has 6 heading levels.</h3>
<h4>We use colour and size to distinguish them.</h4>
<h5>The lower level headings are only barely taller than the body text.</h5>
<h6>But you can still tell that they are headings, because they are big and bold!</h6>
<br />
<p>
    Our standard body text uses the 'Kalam' font. It's a sans-serif font that
    looks a little bit like handwriting. We find it easy to read, even at very small sizes.
</p>
<br />
<span>
    When a bit more formality is required, we use a serif font called 'Kurale'. It looks distinguished, but still fun
    and cute.
</span>
<br />
<pre>
    We use the monospace font 'Kode Mono' inside &lt;pre&gt; tags. When we read it we feel digital and computery.
</pre>
<br />
<div>
    We use an alternate monospace font called 'Fragment Mono' for the user interface elements. It's simpler and easier
    to read at small sizes than 'Kode Mono', so users are not distracted by the user interface, and can focus and the
    website they are viewing.
