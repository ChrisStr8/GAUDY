    <title>GAUDY - Collaboration Demonstration : Connectivity</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Connectivity</h1>
<p>
    GAUDY uses a peer-to-peer architecture. Conductors and collaborators can establish a shared
    session without needing a central authority.
</p>
<br />
<p>
    Only the conductor is responsible for downloading web pages. When it loads a document, it converts the HTML to an
    internal representation and sends it to each collaborator. Collaborators communicate only with the conductor.
</p>
<br />
<p>
    In this proof of concept only the conductor may issue commands. In the future we plan to also allow collaborators
    to activate links, fill out forms, and otherwise control the browsing session. The conductor would relay all of
    this activity to other collaborators.
