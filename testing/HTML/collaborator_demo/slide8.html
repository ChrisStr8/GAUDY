    <title>GAUDY - Collaboration Demonstration : Collaboration Behavior</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Collaboration Behavior</h1>
<p>
    Unlike Zoom or Teams, GAUDY isn't sharing a video feed. This makes it more efficient and flexible, in addition
    to improving security and avoiding embarrassment.

    The collaborator and conductor each have their own independent view of the page, and can resize it, or scroll
    through the document without affecting each other. They can even have different colour schemes.<br />
    This is particularly important when devices are using different font scaling - many devices now have high
    density displays and increase font scaling appropriately, and other people use extra-large text for accessibility.

    The aim of this proof of concept was to demonstrate the session sharing functionality. But we don't want to stop
    there. The ultimate aim is to make collaborative working easier by allowing collaborators to help drive the
    session, not just sit in the back seat.
