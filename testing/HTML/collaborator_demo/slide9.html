<h1>Technology & Implementation</h1>
<p>
    This proof of concept was built using Python3 with the Tkinter module. Python is good for prototypes as it has
    a large number of useful features out of the box. Tkinter is one of these. It is Python's interface for TCL/TK,
    a cross-platform toolkit for building GUI applications. It's responsible for all the text labels, buttons,
    and other interface components.

    The urllib module is being used to download HTML documents from the internet. It supports securely connecting
    to websites via HTTPS, so we can browse the web safely. When a page is loaded we create Tkinter elements for
    the page text.

    Finally, we used the socket module to handle the connection between collaborator and conductor. This module lets
    us establish TCP connections and send data. These connections aren't encrypted in this proof of concept,
    so we don't recommend connecting over the internet!
