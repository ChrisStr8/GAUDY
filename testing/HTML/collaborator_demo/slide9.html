<h2>Python</h2>
<p>
    Python is good for prototyping due to the large amount of features in the base library. This makes it easy to
    create useful programs, although the performance is often sub-par.
</p>
<h2>Tkinter</h2>
<p>
    Tkinter is Python's interface for TCL/TK, a cross-platform system for building graphical user interfaces.
    It is responsible for handling the window, page layout, buttons, and text fields.
</p>
<h2>urllib</h2>
<p>
    This is another Python module that makes it easy to send requests to web servers. We use this to connect to
    websites and download pages.
</p>
<h2>socket</h2>
<p>
    We also use Python's socket module, which is a thin wrapper around the operating system socket interface for
    communicating with the network adaptor. This allows us to connect the conductor and collaborator.
</p>
<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>
    We handle pages in the HyperText Markup Language, more commonly known as HTML. (Almost) all websites use this format
    to represent documents or web-pages. This proof of concept does not support all of HTML, only a limited subset.
