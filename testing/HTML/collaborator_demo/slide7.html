<h1>Collaborator & Conductor</h1>
<p>
    GAUDY has two killer features; bright colours, and friendship!
</p>
<h2>Conductor</h2>
<p>
    Gaudy has two modes of operation. The first is the conductor. It is responsible for connecting to websites and
    downloading content, navigating through the history, and managing the collaborators.
</p>
<h2>Collaborator</h2>
<p>
    The collaborator mode connects to a conductor, and when the conductor visits a page, the collaborator also
    views it. Friends or colleagues can share a web browsing session while limiting access to just viewing the page.
</p>
<br />
<p>
    You can see the conductor and collaborator side by side now. Notice the pretty buttons in the conductor.
