<h1>Basic Features</h1>
<p>
    Like all good web browsers, GAUDY can download HTML documents from the internet, and display them! This
    proof of concept can handle a subset of html, sufficient for sites that are largely text, like blogs.
</p>
<p>
    As you've already seen, this proof on concept supports most of the basic HTML elements, and uses different fonts
    and colours to distinguish them.

    Page data is stored for the browsing session, so that you can revisit pages more quickly. Bigger pages still
    take a little while to load though.
