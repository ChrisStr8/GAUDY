<h1>Basic Features</h1>
<p>
    Like all good web browsers, GAUDY can download HTML documents from the internet, and display them! This
    proof of concept can handle a subset of html, sufficient for sites that are largely text, like blogs.
</p>
<p>
    As you've already seen, this proof on concept supports most of the basic HTML elements, and uses different fonts
    and colours to distinguish them.
</p>
<p>
    GAUDY also caches previously visited pages (within a session), and can move back and forward through
    the site history. Although revisiting a page doesn't download more data, it can still take a moment when there's
    a lot of content - this proof of concept isn't very fast. <br />
    If you look next to the address entry field you can see the navigation buttons - 'Back', 'Forward', and 'Go'.
