<h1>Project Status</h1>
<p>
    The initial proof of concept is complete! We are now able to download a web page,
    show it to the user, and send it to a remote collaborator!
</p>
<br />
<p>
    We are preparing to expand our team.
    The next steps are remote control, and an improved user interface.
</p>
<br />
<p>
    As the project progress we will add to the supported set of HTML, improve the security of the product,
    and consider allowing sites to set their own styles - as long as they are brightly coloured!
