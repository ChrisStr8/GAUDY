# GAUDY

## Description
Gaudy is a web browser (like *Chrome* or *Firefox*) with built-in collaboration capabilities (like *Teams*). Using Gaudy you can browse the web and interact with applications while your colleagues assist you, without risking them seeing sensitive information. 

## Installation
Gaudy uses Python 3.11+, and makes use of the http, urllib, and tkinter modules.

[Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Contributing

Before you get started, please read the [Guiding Principles](https://git.fdmgroup.com/ibis-pod/gaudy/-/wikis/Guiding-Principles). This document explains how we want to conduct ourselves as we develop Gaudy.

We use Git for our version control. If you are reading this, you should already have access to [FDM's GitLab Instance](https://git.fdmgroup.com/ibis-pod/gaudy).

Our branching strategy:

- `Main` is protected and should contain the latest release (ie. the code used in the most recent showcase). `Main` should only be updated by merging from `Dev`.
- `Dev` is where any changes should be made from. When you begin working on a feature, you should branch off from `Dev`. Early in the project we are more relaxed about this, and may make changes directly on `Dev`.
- You should create a feature branch from `Dev` when you are working on a new feature, and merge it back to `Dev` as soon as possible. Even if unfinished, it is good to merge at least every day.

We recommend using PyCharm Community Edition as your IDE.

You should have already been given access to a shared directory on OneDrive with the issue tracker and other documents. These will be migrated to pages viewable in Gaudy Soon™️.
